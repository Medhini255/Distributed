Project Documentation: Setting Up Distributed Prometheus

Introduction-
The goal of this project is to set up a Distributed Prometheus Architecture to monitor various nodes across a network efficiently. 
It involves configuring Prometheus, setting up Node Exporters on different machines, and ensuring connectivity across the network.

The Prometheus Node Exporter exposes a wide variety of hardware- and kernel-related metrics.

Project steps-
Configured prometheus.yml to scrape metrics from different nodes.
Installing Node Exporters on Remote Machines
Ensured Node Exporter was running with the correct network bindings.
Created necessary directories for Node Exporter.
Changed VM network mode to Bridged to allow communication.
Check if Node Exporter is running
Allowed Prometheus to scrape Node Exporter by opening port 9100 in firewall and iptables.
Verified connectivity using ping and curl tests.
Verifying Prometheus Scraping
Used the Prometheus UI (http://<prometheus-ip>:9090) to confirm target status.
